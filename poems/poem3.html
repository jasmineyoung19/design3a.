   <h1>"Applesauce"</h1> 

   <p>
    It was raining and he laughed - a bareheaded boy Laughed for joy
 </p>

 <p>
     "Put on your hat," I said, and frowned - "You'll be drowned!"
 </p>


 <p>"Applesauce!" he cried. "Rain makes me grow - Daddy says so."

 </p>

 <p>
 What reply could I make a boy who laughed for jou
 </p>

<p>
    When the rain poured down, and said "Applesauce!"
    to my frown?
